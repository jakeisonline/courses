## What is this repo?
I like to learn, so I tend to take a lot of courses. I learn best by doing, so I tend to seek out courses that either have me build something with guidance, or challenges me to solve problems myself.

This repo is simply a collection of all outputs of courses I've taken to date. I use this repo to essentially provide myself documentation of past learnings, and so I can easily pick up course work whatever device I happen to be on.
