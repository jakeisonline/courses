I like to learn, so I tend to take a lot of courses. I learn best by doing, so I tend to seek out courses that either have me build something with guidance, or challenges me to solve problems myself.

This repo is a collection of all outputs of courses I've taken to date. I use this repo to provide myself documentation of past learnings, keep track of what I learned and when, and so I can easily pick up course work whatever device I happen to be on.

# Vanity Stats

I think it's fun to track how many courses I've taken, completed, and the total amount of time spent on them.

| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 29 | 4 | 25 | 226.5 hrs (9 days, 10.5 hours) |

Of the courses I've completed, the following topics have been covered:

* JavaScript (12)
