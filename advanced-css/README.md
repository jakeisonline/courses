# Advanced CSS & Sass

Many years ago, I taught myself CSS 2 through a combination of W3C documentation and the scarce resources available at the time. Since then, I've been styling with CSS and mostly kept up with the introduction of new selectors, properties and concepts.

I had a core understanding of newer concept such as `@media` queries and `flex`, I understood them only through documentation and very light usage, while `grid` was not something I was familiar with at all.

## About the course

Written and presented by the excellent [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/) via his Udemy course ["Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and more"](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/), this 28 hour course teaches many of the new concepts I was looking to fully understand.

The course has students create 3 basic websites, each focusing on specific concepts across `@media`, `flex`, `grid` and more. It also aims to teach the basics of NPM and Sass, though I was already familiar with these.

I was able to complete this course in its entirety on June 22, 2020 (I even got a [little certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-e635f622-71ae-489a-a1d8-9d8040b1efa5/)).
