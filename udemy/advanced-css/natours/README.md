## Natours - A showcase of CSS3

This project aims to show how a number of new properties and values introduced in CSS3 function, and how to animate elements and style forms without JavaScript. The project also made heavy use of the [Block Element Modifier (BEM)](http://getbem.com/naming/) naming convetion. Natours is a fictional tour company.

This project also educated on how to tackle responsiveness, using both `@media` queries to achieve specific changes at breakpoints, loading different images for different breakpoints and screen DPR, safe-guarding older browsers with `@supports`, and the discipline of using `rem` for font-sizing, dimensions, and spacing.
