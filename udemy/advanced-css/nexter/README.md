## Nexter - Mighty `grid`

`grid` is an entirely new concept to me. While grid-based layouts have been around for a while, I typically implemented them using `float`. Nexter is a fictional real-estate company, with their website laid out using grid.

And of course, the project also tackled responsiveness.

A full list of all properties and values learned during the project:

`grid`, `grid-row`, `grid-column`, `grid-gap`, `row-gap`, `column-gap`, `grid-template-rows`, `grid-template-columns`, `repeat()`, `minmax()`, `min-content`, `max-content`
