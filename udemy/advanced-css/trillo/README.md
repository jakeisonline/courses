## Trillo - Flexible layouts with `flex`

While I had understood what `flex` was, I had never had a chance to full utilise (and understand) how to use it in different layouts. This project used only flex for all layout. Trillo is a fictional holiday company, with this single-page focusing on a hotel listing.

This project introduced the use of SVG sprites, and just like all projects in this course, responsiveness via `flex` was also addressed.

A full list of all properties and values learned during the project:

`flex`, `flex-direction`, `flex-wrap`, `align-items`, `align-self`, `justify-content`, `var()`, `order`, `fill`, `mask-image`, `mask-size`
