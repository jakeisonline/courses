What better way to start learning SVGs than by drawing some shapes?

Here, we have a little monitor drawn using SVG. Or rather, we had a monitor â€” all the shapes are scattered in the wrong places, with some even having the wrong size.

By changing the properties in the code block below, can you put the monitor back together?

```svg
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <rect
    x="5"
    y="5"
    width="70"
    height="30"
    fill="none"
    stroke="currentColor"
    stroke-width="3"
  />
  <rect
    x="60"
    y="55"
    width="15"
    height="30"
    fill="currentColor"
  />
  <line
    x1="15"
    y1="90"
    x2="35"
    y2="75"
    stroke="currentColor"
    stroke-width="2"
  />
</svg>
```

<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <rect
    x="5"
    y="5"
    width="70"
    height="30"
    fill="none"
    stroke="currentColor"
    stroke-width="3"
  />
  <rect
    x="60"
    y="55"
    width="15"
    height="30"
    fill="currentColor"
  />
  <line
    x1="15"
    y1="90"
    x2="35"
    y2="75"
    stroke="currentColor"
    stroke-width="2"
  />
</svg>
